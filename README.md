# Nextcloud Apps TS Client

Some AI-Mimimi for the beginning:
> A powerful API client for Nextcloud apps, written in TypeScript. This client provides an easy way to interact with various Nextcloud apps, including Bookmarks, Deck, and Notes. Additionally, you can use the `NextcloudAuthClient` to handle authentication based on the LoginFlowV2 proposed by Nextcloud. The "General" app includes calls for capabilities and auto-completion.

I created this client out of personal curiosity to
* a) create an npm package
* b) a personal project using deck / notes and bookmark

I am not sure how much support I can give, but lets see.

bun add @samuelspagl/nc-api-client

## 🛠️ Usage

```js
import { NextcloudClient } from '@samuelspagl/nc-api-client';

const client = new NextcloudClient('https://cloud.example.com', 'username', 'password');

async function fetchBookmarks() {
    try {
        const bookmarks = await client.bookmarks.queryBookmarks();
        console.log('Fetched bookmarks:', bookmarks);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching bookmarks:', error);
    }
}

One can also import the single clients from:
